Just open-sourced QGravityUI (https://github.com/danilevsky/qgravityui) - the Gravity UI design system as a native Qt Quick component library.

I build C++/Qt desktop apps for a living, and the same gap shows up on every project: web teams get a design system off the shelf, Qt teams get Qt Quick Controls plus a designer's Figma file, and someone burns a month reconciling the two.

So I ported one. QGravityUI brings Gravity UI (https://gravity-ui.com/) to QML with no web engine and no React anywhere in the stack:

- 65 controls - GButton, GTable, GDropdownMenu, GToaster, GTreeList and the rest
- 4 themes, high-contrast light and dark included
- 130 semantic colors × 4 themes, 18 typography steps, per-component metrics for 30 components
- 799 icons from @gravity-ui/icons, recolored and HiDPI-correct
- Inter bundled and self-registering — nothing to install
- Qt Design Studio metadata, qmllint-clean, compiled by qmlsc

Qt 6.11+, CMake 3.21+, C++17, MIT. Independent port, not an official Gravity UI project.

Stars, issues and honest criticism all welcome!
